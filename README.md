This fork focuses on the development of a new major release for JPlag, including the following changes:

* *Work in progress.*

**Note:** Due to the early stage of development, many details documented below might change before the official release of version 3.0.

## Download and Installation

### Building from sources 

1. Download or clone the code from this repository.
2. Run `mvn clean install` from the root of the repository to install all submodules. You will find the JARs in the respective `target` directories.
3. Inside the `jplag` directory run `mvn clean generate-sources package assembly:single`. 

You'll find the generated JAR with all dependencies in  `jplag/target`.

## Usage

### CLI

*Work in progress.*

### Java API

The new API makes it easy to integrate JPlag's plagiarism detection into external Java projects.

#### Example 

```java
JPlagOptions options = new JPlagOptions("/path/to/rootDir", LanguageOption.JAVA_1_9);

JPlag jplag = new JPlag(options);
JPlagResult result = jplag.run();

List<JPlagComparison> comparisons = result.getComparisons();

// Optional
result.export();
```

#### Classes

##### JPlag

##### JPlagOptions

##### JPlagResult

##### JPlagComparison

### Configuration Options

#### Required

##### Root directory

##### Language

**Note:** java19 refers to all java version from 9 on (currently 9 - 12).

#### Optional

## Contributing
We're happy to incorporate all improvements to JPlag into this code base. Feel free to fork the project and send pull requests.

### Adding new languages
Adding a new language frontend is quite simple. Have a look at one of the `jplag.frontend` projects. All you need is a parser for the language (e.g., for ANTLR or for JavaCC) and a few lines of code that sends the tokens (that are generated by the parser) to JPlag.
